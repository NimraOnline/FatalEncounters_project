Published CU Scholar Research by Nimra Sharnez (p. 109)

Aims: To understand the similarities in fatal encounters with law enforcement by race throughout
American counties. Design: This analysis utilizes the 2017 American Community Survey US Census
Demographic Data to understand county demographics and economic structures. The crowd-sourced
database from fatalencounters.org documented fatal encounters by race from the years 2000 to 2019
was traced back to the county and state of occurrence. Statistical tests were then performed to relate
race, location demographic, and socioeconomic structures of location. Results: There were significant
differences throughout the races and fatal encounter with law enforcement. Further analysis is to be done
on the predictive features of spatial distribution and opportunities in the United States amongst racial
communities.
